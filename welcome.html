                  TRAVELING.... AND ARIZONA </h2>
      
      
      
     Basically, I really like traveling. It's been super rainy the past few days so I didn't feel inspired so take many photos but over the last year, I traveled to a lot of awesome spots and I used images from those trips to create this web page. I became very complacent and depressed after working at Chrysler for five years right out of high-school... so I quit. I used money I had saved over my time working their and spent the year taking different trips, to visit family and go hiking. <BR>
          <br>
 
Below is a photo that I took in Arizona, at Devil's Bridge.  Devil's Bridge I would rate as a medium difficulty hike that is out and back 4.2 miles. The hike leads to an amazing look out point of some beatiful red rocks in Sedona. Initially I went to Arizona because I had planned to hike Havasupai Falls and realized I was DRAMATICALL unprepared for that hike. Sedona wasn't on my list of places to visit during that trip but I ended up spending several days there because I fell in love with it. <BR> 
          <BR> 
              I spent alot of time in California growing up, so I was use to seeing mountains but I had never seen mountains like that before. The way the sun hits the red rocks is so breath taking. While I was in Sedona I learn about the Sedonda Vortices... yes, I am into spirtual woo-woo B.S. and metaphysical stuff. 
              Sedona is considered have "vortex energy". Vortices are places where the earth seems especially alive with energy. Many people feel inspired, recharged or uplifted after visiting a vortex. If you've ever been to Sedona, I think it's hard to deny that you feel SOMETHING different energetically there.

     <p>Below, is a video I took on my first "long" back-packing trip. I went with a friend I've know since high school. This video is a little embarassing to include but it is the first "vlog" I made... I used only my photo to edit and shoot it and I had a lot of fun editing it.

        The trail we hiked was Eagle Rock Loop in Ouchita National Forest... it's roughly a 30 mile trail where you actually hike 5 different mountain peaks. I didn't realize that before commiting to the hike it was one of the most difficult loop trails in the United States. I thought I was going to die several times during the hike... after I got home, I lost 4 differnt toe nails. Anyways.... just watch the video.

 <h2>Utah... and California.</h2> 
          
          <div class="angel" style="height:275px;"></div> <BR> 
        
        Utah is the coolest place I have ever been, hands down. I want to live there at some point in my life. I've looked into transfering to college there. Out of all the places I went in the past year, I was most excited for Utah. While I was there I spent most of my time in Zion National Park, which was amazing. I hiked the Narrows and Angel's Landing... both of them were so cool. THe photo above is my on top of Angels Landing... if you ever get a chance fricken go! <BR> <BR> 
          
        
        Below is a photo of a random beach along the highway in Monteray Bay. California holds a special place in my heart because I've been going there since I was an infant and my mom lived there my entire life, most of her family lives there as well. Last November I made a trip out to California and for the first time in my adult life, I drove the coast of Big Sur until I got to the road closing that resulted from the mud slide that happeend because of all the rain. Esentailly the cost of California is falling off. Big Sur is CRAZY!!! <br>
